											Communications Policy

The expectations for our meetings going forward will be to keep it light-hearted, and help any other group member who needs it. For the time being we are going to be holding our meetings on Saturday around 7:30-8:30pm. Strategy for conflict resolution would be listening to both sides and trying to figure out a happy medium. More to be established in the future.
