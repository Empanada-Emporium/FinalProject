											Communications Policy

The expectations for our meetings going forward will be to keep it light-hearted, and help any other group member who needs it. We will be doing weekly informal meetings every Friday after class on the Discord application from 3-4 or 4:30 depending on the state/progress of the project. Strategy for conflict resolution would be listening to both sides and trying to figure out a happy medium. More to be established in the future.
